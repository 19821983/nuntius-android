Nuntius
===================================

##Introduction
Nuntius delivers notifications from your phone or tablet to your computer over Bluetooth.

Nuntius is an Open Source project from HolyLobster.

To use Nuntius you will need to install a companion tool on your computer and pair your phone via Bluetooth.

For more information on the project and the companion tools to install on the computer check https://github.com/holylobster

##The Icon
You may have questions on the icon. Nice shot.
In fact most of the Nuntius development time has been spent on the icon design concept.
If you have suggestions on how to improve it we are very open... but... we think it is hardly possible to do better than this.
